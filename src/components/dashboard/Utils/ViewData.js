    transcriptomics profiling of germline and tumor samples from an\
    early-onset triple-negative breast cancer patient who later was\
    administrated with a PARP inhibitor for 2 months. We demonstrated in\
    cell and mouse models that, compared to the wild-type, (1) c.403G>A\
    mutant cell lines were more sensitive to irradiation, a DNA damage\
    agent, and a PARP inhibitor; (2) c.403G>A mutation inhibited\
    interaction between BARD1 and RAD51 (but not BRCA1); and (3)\
    c.403G>A mutant mice were hypersensitive to ionizing radiation. Our\
    study shed lights on the clinical interpretation of rare germline\
    mutations of BARD1.'
